Living with knee osteoarthritis can be challenging. From pain and stiffness to reduced mobility, this joint condition affects the daily lives of countless Australians. Fortunately, you don’t have to settle for a life defined by discomfort. The best injection service for pain relief at Crystal Radiology offers effective therapies designed to reduce pain, restore function, and help patients regain active lifestyles.
Understanding Knee Osteoarthritis
Knee osteoarthritis is a joint disorder caused by the gradual wearing away of cartilage. When cartilage breaks down, bones begin to rub directly against each other, leading to symptoms such as:
•	Persistent knee pain, especially when moving
•	Swelling and stiffness in the joint
•	Decreased range of motion
•	Grinding sensations during movement 
There are two main types:
•	Osteoarthritis (OA): A degenerative disease commonly linked to ageing and joint stress.
•	Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Less common in knees, RA is an autoimmune condition causing inflammation.
Key Causes and Risk Factors
Knee osteoarthritis has a range of contributing factors:
•	Age: Increased risk with growing older
•	Weight: Extra weight increases strain on the knees
•	Prior Injury: Previous injuries or repeated joint stress
•	Genetics: Family history of osteoarthritis
Recognising these risk factors is crucial for prevention and management.
How Knee Osteoarthritis Is Diagnosed
Accurate diagnosis leads to better treatments. Doctors use:
•	Physical examinations to assess pain, swelling, and motion
•	X-rays to show cartilage loss and bone changes
•	MRI for a detailed look at soft tissues
•	Blood tests to rule out other types of arthritis
Lifestyle Changes for Managing Pain
Before considering injections or medical treatments, certain changes can make a big difference.
1.	Exercise Regularly
Engage in low-impact physical activities:
•	Walking
•	Cycling
•	Swimming or water aerobics
These strengthen muscles, improve stability, and boost flexibility.
2.	Weight Management
Losing even a small amount of weight reduces pressure on knees, significantly easing pain.
•	Healthy Diet
Choose foods that reduce inflammation and support bone health:
•	Omega-3-rich fish, nuts, and seeds
•	Leafy greens for calcium and vitamin D
•	Limit processed foods and sugars
3.	Medication and Movement Therapies
Doctors may recommend:
•	NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for pain relief
•	Yoga to enhance flexibility and reduce discomfort
